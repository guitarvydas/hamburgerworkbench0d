Load "hamburgerworkbench0d.html" into a browser and hit the "hamburger" button.

0D => zero dependency (composable)

A (very simple) example of creating an HTML app using 0D components.

See `hamburger0d.html`.

See, also, `hamburgerworkbench0d.drawio` for a diagram of the example.

See, also, [hamburger](https://github.com/guitarvydas/hamburger) for the same app done the usual way (I call this N0D (non-zero-dependency)).

Next stop: creating the complete app from a `.drawio` file and foregoing the intermediate text code.
